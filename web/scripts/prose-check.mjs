// Prose check: keep the words in the product plain.

// The decks are gated on this already (build/ey_qa.py). The application was
// not, so the copy drifted into the same habits: em-dashes, "X, not Y"
// antithesis, short slogan sentences, consulting filler, and a signposting tic
// that tells the reader something is important instead of just saying it.
//
// This reads user-visible strings out of the source and fails on those
// patterns. It is deliberately narrow: it checks copy a reader sees, not
// comments and not identifiers, because a comment explaining a decision to the
// next engineer is doing a different job from a sentence on a page.
//
// The Overview surface is excluded. It is the marketing landing page and it is
